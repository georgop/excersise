<h3>How to run</h3>
`npm install`  
`npm run dev`

<h3>Few words</h3>
I used Vue 3 with Composition API , Typescript and Vite.<br>
Additionally I used vue-router for the routing and a little bit of Bootstrap for some components.

Lastly, I consumed this API for displaying some information about the location of each user.
