<h3>Few words</h3>
I used Vue 3 with Composition API , Typescript and Vite.<br>
Additionally I used vue-router for the routing and a little bit of Bootstrap for some components.

Lastly, I consumed this API for displaying some information about the location of each user.

Unfortunately only one out of ten users had accurate lat/lng coordinates.

The app is responsive for widths of 360px and more.
